## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow
- BEM naming convention

### What I learned

I learned its helpful to reduce the amount of repetitive code. At fist I was selecting each element and applying color styling to each.
After looking through my code, I thought it would be much easier to understand if I were to just put the same css styles on a single 
class instead of each individual element. It also made editing the css easier.

```css
.text--primary{
    color: var(--color-stone-600);
}

.text--secondary {
    color: var(--color-brown-800);
}
```

### Continued development

Looking back on some of my old work, I realize its important that the code is readable so I really want to focus on that going forward.
I've used only basic html and css to create these sites, in the next one I might try using react or vue.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10040842/add-border-bottom-to-table-row-tr) - I could not figure out how to add the line separators in the nutrition table section. Stack Overflow really helped me find an easy solution.
